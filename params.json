{"name":"The Wealthy Laughing Duck Project","tagline":"Manage your home finances with an easy web app.","body":"Introduction\r\n------------\r\n\r\nWealthy Laughing Duck is in fact a simple logic model that can be adapted by\r\nvarious applications and platforms. It's supposed to be a personal finance\r\nmanaging system. All duck components are just implementations of this model,\r\ne.g. web interface implemented with JavaScript, Java Thrift server / PHP\r\nThrift client, python RESTful API (consumed by JavaScript interface) and so on.\r\n\r\nMost of duck components are in early development phase so far, but the aim is\r\nto make them mature, stable systems that would rely on different technologies\r\nused. Developers would clone and easily deploy github repositories and examine\r\nthe implementation to learn the technologies.\r\n\r\nContribution\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThis is more than welcome :) The more contributions and group members there\r\nare, the more the duck project will improve. If you wish to make some commits\r\nto existing repositories - or even create your own repository that illustrates\r\na technology that's not present in the duck project yet - just contact the\r\n@wealthy-laughing-duck.\r\n","google":"UA-43456870-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
