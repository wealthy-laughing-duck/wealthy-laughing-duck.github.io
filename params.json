{"name":"The Wealthy Laughing Duck Project","tagline":"Manage your home finances with an easy web app.","body":"Content to be added here shortly...\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nWealthy Laughing Duck is in fact a simple logic model that can be adapted by various applications and platforms. It's supposed to be a personal finance managing system. All duck components are just implementations of this model, e.g. web interface implemented with JavaScript, Java Thrift server / PHP Thrift client, python RESTful API (consumed by JavaScript interface) and so on.\r\n\r\nMost of duck components are in early development phase so far, but the aim is to make them mature, stable systems that would rely on different technologies used. Developers would clone and easily deploy github repositories and examine the implementation to learn the technologies.\r\n\r\nContribution\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThis is more than welcome :) The more contributions and group members there are, the more the duck project will improve. If you wish to make some commits to existing repositories - or even create your own repository that illustrates a technology that's not present in the duck project yet - just contact the @wealthy-laughing-duck.","google":"UA-43456870-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
